# tangova-dev-launchpad
A shell cordova app with the tangova tango bindings plugin and maximally permissive security settings so that development code can be live-loaded from an http server.

## What this comes with
* [tangova project tango bindings](https://github.com/PyryM/tangova)
* Crosswalk webview
* Very lenient security settings so you can redirect the app with window.location=devhost/devcode.html
* A convenient url box so you can redirect the app without having to open a remote debugging console
